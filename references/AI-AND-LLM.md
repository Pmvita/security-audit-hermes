# AI, LLM, and Agent Hunting

## When to use this file

Reach for this file when a language model participates in a trust-sensitive decision: chatbots and assistants, RAG pipelines, persistent agent memory, agent/tool-calling loops, MCP servers and clients, code that builds prompts from untrusted input, or code that consumes model output and acts on it. The important data flow is *untrusted content → model or memory → capability, authority, or sink*.

## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Prompt injection alone is not a finding. Require a code-level boundary failure: content reaches another principal's context, invokes authority the requester lacks, discloses data they cannot read, or drives a sink they cannot reach directly.
- Model output, memory, tool descriptions, and MCP responses are untrusted inputs. Point to the code that grants authority, trusts output, writes durable state, or feeds a sink.
- A guardrail prompt is not a security boundary. Count only deterministic checks, resource-scoped authorization, isolation, binding, and constrained credentials.
- State the attacker, affected principal, effective execution identity, resource, exact action, authority used, and observable impact. An intentional direct request to use the requester's existing authority is not a delegation defect merely because a model executes it.
- Authorization and action binding are separate controls. Attacker-controlled content that causes an action under an affected principal's valid authority is an action-binding failure when that principal did not intentionally request or approve the exact action.
- Classify every candidate as `confirmed` only after source evidence and bounded local validation establish the boundary and result. Use `needs_validation` when a required provider, deployment, model, renderer, or identity behavior is not observable locally.

## Context, retrieval, and memory attack classes

**Indirect injection through retrieved or ingested content**
An attacker can write a RAG document, indexed page, file, email, issue body, tool response, or metadata that enters a different principal's model context. Trace who can write each source, how retrieval scopes it, whose session consumes it, and what capability is enabled there.

**Persistent memory poisoning**
Attacker-controlled content or model summaries are written into memory that later shapes another task, user, or privileged session. Review who may create, update, merge, and delete memory; its provenance and tenant scope; whether low-trust observations become durable instructions or facts; and whether retrieval distinguishes user preferences from tool policy.

## Tool and action attack classes

**Action-confirmation and approval binding**
A user approves one described action but execution can use changed arguments, a different resource, a different principal, or a later model turn. An action-binding defect also exists when attacker-controlled content causes a side effect under a victim's valid authority without the victim's intentional request or approval, even if generic authorization permits the victim to perform it.

## MCP and sub-agent trust classes

**Sub-agent and MCP trust inheritance**
A delegated task receives the full session, credentials, memory, or capabilities rather than the least authority required. Check the principal and tenant carried into each call, capability narrowing, credential audience, and whether delegated results are treated as untrusted on return.

## Output and disclosure attack classes

**Insecure output rendering**
Model output reaches an executing HTML, Markdown, template, URL, or command sink without the sink's required encoding and policy. For browser rendering, verify auto-loaded resources and CSP or sanitization in [CLIENT-SIDE.md](CLIENT-SIDE.md); renderer behavior outside the repository makes the candidate `needs_validation`.

## Validation rules

For action-binding claims, prove attacker-controlled content caused an action under the affected principal's authority that the principal did not intentionally request or approve. Valid generic authorization does not establish that intent.

For memory or retrieval claims, cite both the attacker-controlled write and the later cross-principal read or privileged decision.

## Hermes Agent notes

- Use `delegate_task` for spawning hunter/verifier agents
- MCP integration: use Hermes's native MCP client (`config.yaml` → `mcp_servers`)
- Use `read_file`, `search_files` for source inspection
- Use `terminal` for bounded local checks within sandbox
